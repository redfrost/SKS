			<p>My first encounter with ‘fro-yo’ was back in 2007.</p>
			<p>My roommate at the time, Chris told me about this crazy frozen yogurt ice cream he found during his travels in the US which he was addicted to and how he couldn‘t find this product in Sydney.</p>
			<p>As a joke, Chris told me that he would pay me $1000 if I could somehow fly it over here without melting. Being roommates since uni days, we were uber competitive and I took him up on the bet.</p>
			<p>After numerous ‘stop joking around kid’ and frustrating ‘I’ll transfer you to the relevant department’ responses from the US, I decided to take it on myself to research how to make frozen yogurt at home.</p>
			<p>I bought a run down ice cream machine for a couple of hundred dollars on e-bay (which we still have at our office) and constantly experimented with different formulas to get the right tangy and sweet taste.</p>
			<p>After endless trials along with numerous power outs at the unit block caused by the machine, I finally developed a perfect frozen yogurt my roommate could not deny and sold the first Noggi in 2008 for $1000! </p>
			<p>I have to credit Chris with the business idea and the product. But in all fairness, I’ve promised him his $1000 back if he can find a way to fly Noggi frozen yogurt over to the states without melting. Soon after, friends heard about the frozen yogurt and came over to taste it.</p>
			<p>This became a weekend event at my house and eventually friends of friends would come over and order takeaway!</p>
			<p>And so in 2009 Noggi was born..</p>
